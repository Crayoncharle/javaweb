# introduction
In order to investigate the education status of colleges and universities, a college satisfaction questionnaire system based on Spring Boot is developed on the existing basis. Through this system, students' satisfaction with various services of colleges and universities is collected and analyzed to provide data support and decision-making reference.
The routine questionnaire method plays an increasingly important role in statistical analysis of all walks of life, and many data are collected through the extensive use of questionnaire and interview methods. In order to further understand the deep-seated needs and conditions of the investigated objects, do a good job in statistical analysis and investigation, and reflect the situation of investigators more objectively and accurately, it is necessary to design and practice a questionnaire survey system. The questionnaire system is built on the basis of the Internet, and constructs a questionnaire design, release, statistics and content collection system relying on the network.
